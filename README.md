# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
A collection of my credentials, projects, and more as I develop my skills in cybersecurity.

# About
I am Myriam Mahmoud. I am a security analyst who is dedicated to exploring diverse areas of cybersecurity including networking, cloud, penetration, governance, and automation to develop a comprehensive understanding of modern security practices and vulnerabilities. My goals with this multidisciplinary approach is to uphold effective communication in team environments.

To delve into the security world, I obtained my CompTIA Security+ certificate. I am also working toward acquiring the knowledge of the CompTIA Network+ and A+ certificates. To compliment the knowledge that I am obtaining from all of these areas of study, I will familiarize myself with CDR, IDS, IPS, EDR, SIEM, SOAR, packet analyzers, and additional tools. In relation to alert investigation, I have a basic understanding of utilizng IOCs and OSINT thanks to resources like CyberDefenders. However, I'd like to eventually apply the NIST and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks to practice effective threat recognition, prevention, and response plans through other means.

To see the steps that I have taken so far to reach the above goals, you can view my portfolio below
